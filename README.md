## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Template Project Backend

## Formatting using PHP Coding Standard Fixer

We are using the php cs fixer package in order to format the php files in the project. The package also has a corresponding vs code extension. This extension has been added to the extension.json file as recommended.

The way the package works is that we provide a set of files for it to parse and then it will apply a set of rules on those files. There is a .php-cs-fixer.php file in the root of the project where we can specify both the paths to the files and also the rules.

There are some predefined coding standards like PSR1, PSR2, PSR12, but the package comes with some additional rules as well.

In the following [link](https://gist.github.com/laravel-shift/cab527923ed2a109dda047b97d53c200) we can find a setup for rules in a laravel project.

Using the vscode extension we can format the files on save, but there is also a command:
```
composer format
```
that will format all the files specified in the config file at once.
